### 📖 Abstract

With the rapid growth of car ownership and the continuous reform of the auto insurance industry, the importance of accurate rate-setting and efficient claims management is more prominent than ever. Traditional pricing models often struggle with complex risk factors and non-linear data.

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to conduct an in-depth study on the prediction of auto insurance claims. By performing a comparative analysis of multiple models (including Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and CatBoost), this project aims to build a high-accuracy binary classification model and identify the key features that most significantly impact claim probability.
